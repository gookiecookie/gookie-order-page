  body: `
    <div class="footer-info-card">
      <h3>Do I need to order a whole box?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Every order starts from <strong>1 box</strong>.
        Individual cookies are not available so your Gookies fit the packaging properly
        and the delivery charge remains worthwhile.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="footer-info-card">
      <h3>Can I build my own box?</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely. Choose your favourite flavours with
        <strong>Build Your Box</strong>, or pick one of our ready-made Gookie’s Picks.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="footer-info-card">
      <h3>When is my order confirmed?</h3>
      <p>
        Your order is confirmed after you send the completed order to Gookie through
        WhatsApp and your payment has been verified.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="footer-info-card">
      <h3>Can I change my flavour or delivery address?</h3>
      <p>
        Flavour selections and delivery addresses cannot be changed once the order has
        been placed. Every order is sent directly to the kitchen team, so this helps us
        prevent confusion and preparation errors.
